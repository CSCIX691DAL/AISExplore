# AISExplore
The automatic identification system (AIS) is an automatic tracking system that uses transponders on ships and is used by vessel traffic services (VTS). [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_identification_system)

The AISExplore project collects and allows for the display of these messages.

The map will load all ships within the current view from the server
 
### Developer Api

Developers can access the raw database output without updating the map by accessing the following urls which return JSON
Arrays with the specified data.

> localhost:8000/raw/latest

Will return the latest entries for all ships in the database in the format {"results": {database entrys}},
With all database entries in the form of key pair values of the mmsi and the latest entry for that ship

> localhost:8000/raw/region/{geometry}

Will return the entries for all ships in the database in whose coordinate points lie within the coordinates supplied in json format
after region/, the geometry must be valid json and each point must be specified in a list, any amount of coordinates can be provided 
but take care as point order matters, you may end up asking for an hourglass rather than a square also you don't need to close the geometry
it will be take care of for you.
(Ex. {"nw":[40.32, -60.21], "ne":[39.50, -60.21], "se":[39.50, -61.20], "sw":[40.32, -61.20] })

> localhost:8000/raw/search/[criteria]
